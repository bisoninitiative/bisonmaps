        "Description": "Our 240-acre farm is located just north of Lincoln, Arkansas, in the southern part of the Ozarks. The farm was originally established in the 1850s.  Herbert and Marilyn Weyl, our parents, purchased the farm in 1965. Today it’s divided almost evenly between open pasture for grazing and woodlands used for foraging by cattle, livestock, and poultry.  We offer beef from Angus, Hereford, and other breeds—raised using grass, hay, and silvopasture methods. All processing is done through USDA-inspected or custom-exempt facilities, with dry-aging and vacuum-sealing for maximum quality.  Whether you're picking up at a local retail store or investing in a herdshare, we offer a variety of flexible options to fit your family's needs.",
